Project Proposal

The client here is a payment service company that is trying to avoid fraudulent transactions
by predicting if a transaction is fraud or not. 

Dataset:
For this project I am using the customer transactions based on a Kaggle data set from a leading payment service company, Vesta Corporation. The data comes from Vesta's real-world e-commerce transactions and contains a wide range of features from device type to product features. There are about 189000 rows in the dataset.

The Target here is the column “isFraud”, which predicts whether or not a transaction is fraudulent.

Tools:
Logistic Regression
XG Boost
Pandas
Scikit Learn
Seaborn
Matplotlib

The evaluation metric here would be to increase Recall which is the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples.

The MVP for this project will be a visual based on a few key features that helps in deciding whether a transaction is fraud or not.
